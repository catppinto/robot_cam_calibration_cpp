		  FIXED TAG CALIBRATION 
**********************************************************
DESCRIPTION: 

	Move the manipulator into several spots and recover the tag pose. Write to file and record the matrix. the tf are listened and 
the tf from the camera to the world (basis of the robot) is computed as an average of all the tf recorded. the pose of the tags comes from Apriltags, which matches the corners of the tags found with a square with the size specified (0.048 m). The tf from world->worldTB and world->tag are recorded in files robot_tf_publishing.launch and tags_tf_publishing.launch in folder 
/home/cat/catkin_ws/src/biovision/cat_move_to_target/launch

HOW TO RUN: 

roslaunch cat_robotcam_calibration backFunction_calibration.launch

roslaunch cat_robotcam_calibration run_calibration_new.launch

COMENTS: 
the mean is not a robust statistic form to do this. should be done with least sqrs, for instance. (see fixed tag calibration) 
also the matching with the sqr can give errors.
